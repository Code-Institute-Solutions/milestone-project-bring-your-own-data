## Codeanywhere Template Instructions

Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for Codeanywhere. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions. Click the `Use this template` button above to get started.

You can safely delete the IDE Template Instructions section of this README.md file,  and modify the remaining paragraphs for your own project. Please do read the IDE Template Instructions at least once, though! It contains some important information about the IDE and the extensions we use. 

## How to use this repo

1. Use this template to create your GitHub project repo

1. Log into <a href="https://app.codeanywhere.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CodeAnywhere</a> with your GitHub account.

1. On your Dashboard, click on the New Workspace button

1. Paste in the URL you copied from GitHub earlier

1. Click Create

1. Wait for the workspace to open. This can take a few minutes.

1. Open a new terminal and <code>pip3 install -r requirements.txt</code>

1. In the terminal type <code>pip3 install jupyter</code>

1. In the terminal type <code>jupyter notebook --NotebookApp.token='' --NotebookApp.password=''</code> to start the jupyter server.

1. Open port 8888 preview or browser

1. Open the jupyter_notebooks directory in the jupyter webpage that has opened and click on the notebook you want to open.

1. Click the button Not Trusted and choose Trust.

Note that the kernel says Python 3. It inherits from the workspace so it will be Python-3.8.12 as installed by our template. To confirm this you can use <code>! python --version</code> in a notebook code cell.

## IDE Reminders

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In the IDE terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.


## Dataset Content
* Describe your dataset. Choose a dataset of reasonable size to avoid exceeding the repository's maximum size and to have a shorter model training time. If you are doing an image recognition project, we suggest you consider using an image shape that is 100px × 100px or 50px × 50px, to ensure the model meets the performance requirement but is smaller than 100Mb for a smoother push to GitHub. A reasonably sized image set is ~5000 images, but you can choose ~10000 lines for numeric or textual data. 


## Business Requirements
* Describe your business requirements


## Hypothesis and how to validate?
* List here your project hypothesis(es) and how you envision validating it (them) 


## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualizations and ML tasks
* List your business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualizations and ML tasks


## ML Business Case
* In the previous bullet, you potentially visualized an ML task to answer a business requirement. You should frame the business case using the method we covered in the course 


## Dashboard Design
* List all dashboard pages and their content, either blocks of information or widgets, like buttons, checkboxes, images, or any other item that your dashboard library supports.
* Later, during the project development, you may revisit your dashboard plan to update a given feature (for example, at the beginning of the project you were confident you would use a given plot to display an insight but subsequently you used another plot type).



## Unfixed Bugs
* You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a significant variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

## Deployment
### Heroku

* The App live link is: https://YOUR_APP_NAME.herokuapp.com/ 
* Set the runtime.txt Python version to a [Heroku-20](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-support#supported-runtimes) stack currently supported version.
* The project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps.

1. Log in to Heroku and create an App
2. At the Deploy tab, select GitHub as the deployment method.
3. Select your repository name and click Search. Once it is found, click Connect.
4. Select the branch you want to deploy, then click Deploy Branch.
5. The deployment process should happen smoothly if all deployment files are fully functional. Click now the button Open App on the top of the page to access your App.
6. If the slug size is too large then add large files not required for the app to the .slugignore file.


## Main Data Analysis and Machine Learning Libraries
* Here you should list the libraries you used in the project and provide an example(s) of how you used these libraries.


## Credits 

* In this section, you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 
* You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.
